Machine Learning MNIST
======================
Train MNIST Network
_____________________
MNIST Network is regarded as the most fundmental model of deep convolutional neural network. The network structure is simple but it has basic conceptions in CNN, like convolutional layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer .etc. This project is a complete demo to show the magic of MNIST. 
This repository contains:

  1. The dataset particular for MNIST network, you can also download from [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ "dataset").
  2. A train file can training and test the MNIST network.
  3. A visualization file to show the loss and accuracy of training and test procedure respectively.
